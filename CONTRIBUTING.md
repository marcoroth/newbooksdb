# BooksDB Contributing Guidelines

First of all - thank you for looking at these guidelines, as this means you think about contributing to the BooksDB project - being a hobby programmer with just enough skills to develop something like this for my own use (and then deciding that I could as well make it public), this means a lot to me! :)

For information on how to setup your environment, dependencies etc, please check the readme file.

### Require help?

As this is a free time project, and as I am a mere hobby programmer, I do not have time to give any support or guidance. If there is an issue, file one (see above). Other than that, see above how to get in touch with me - but no support guaranteed. :)
